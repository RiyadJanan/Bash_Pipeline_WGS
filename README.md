# Whole Genome Sequencing Pipeline for Monogenic Diabetes
This project involved the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for a proband diagnosed with pancreatic agenesis and heart defects, as part of a trio analysis (proband, mother, father). The WGS data was processed through an automated bioinformatics pipeline developed in bash, covering all stages from genome alignment to variant calling and annotation. A de novo splice site variant in the **LZTR1** gene, associated with **Noonan Syndrome 10 (NS10)**, was identified as the likely cause of the probandâ€™s clinical presentation. The pipeline was designed for automation, crash resilience, scalability, and reproducibility, ensuring efficient processing and accurate variant identification in high-throughput WGS datasets.
