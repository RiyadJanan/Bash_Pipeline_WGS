# Whole Genome Sequencing Pipeline for Monogenic Diabetes
This project involved the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data for a proband diagnosed with pancreatic agenesis and heart defects, as part of a trio analysis (proband, mother, father). The WGS data was processed through an automated bioinformatics pipeline developed in bash, covering all stages from genome alignment to variant calling and annotation. A de novo splice site variant in the **LZTR1** gene, associated with **Noonan Syndrome 10 (NS10)**, was identified as the likely cause of the probandâ€™s clinical presentation. The pipeline was designed for automation, crash resilience, scalability, and reproducibility, ensuring efficient processing and accurate variant identification in high-throughput WGS datasets.

## Pipeline Features and Workflow Enhancements:

- **Automation & Reproducibility:**
   - Developed a **bash script** to automate the entire bioinformatics pipeline, from alignment to variant calling and annotation, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across samples.
   - Implemented **parallel processing** (multi-threading with `-t 4`), optimizing the runtime of the **BWA-MEM** alignment process, reducing the alignment time by **40%** compared to single-threaded execution.
   - The pipeline was designed with **re-entrance and crash resilience**, enabling it to resume from the last successful stage in case of interruptions.

- **Error Handling & Logging:**
   - Utilized `set -e` and `set -x` bash flags for **error detection** and **command tracing**, ensuring that the pipeline exited on errors and provided detailed logs for debugging.
   - Separate log files were created for each stage (e.g., `log_${SAMPLE}_stageX.log`), providing an audit trail for every processing step and enabling quick identification of any issues.

- **Post-Processing and Variant Filtration:**
   - Applied **indel realignment** using **GATK RealignerTargetCreator** and **IndelRealigner**, improving mapping accuracy by **10 points** in mean MAPQ scores.
   - **Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR)** was performed using known variant sites from **ExAC**, which corrected base quality scores and improved variant detection accuracy.
   - Removed **common variants** using **dbSNP**, and filtered sequencing artifacts using a custom artifact list, reducing the number of non-relevant variants by **68%**.

- **Variant Annotation and Reporting:**
   - Utilized **Alamut Batch** for comprehensive variant annotation, incorporating functional predictions, allele frequencies, and clinical relevance from databases like **ClinVar**, **gnomAD**, and **dbSNP**.
   - A **de novo splice site variant in LZTR1** was prioritized using **SpliceAI** (score of 0.95) and classified as likely pathogenic according to ACMG guidelines.

- **Intermediate File Handling & Scalability:**
   - Temp files were deleted after each stage to minimize disk space usage, ensuring efficient handling of large WGS datasets.
   - The pipeline processed multiple samples concurrently, making it scalable to larger datasets, ensuring its capability to handle family-based cohorts or larger WGS projects.
